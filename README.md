# Dice Game

This is a simple dice game implemented in Python for two players. The players take turns rolling a die and accumulate points based on their rolls.

## Rules

- Each player takes turns rolling a die.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their points for that turn and their turn ends.
- Players can choose to stop rolling and keep their points after rolling the die three consecutive times without rolling a 1.
- The first player to reach the target score (500 points) wins the game.
